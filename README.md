# LEDApp
*This is a work in progress* 
<br>
I've created this WPF app as a personal project to help me learn how to work with LED panels. 
<br><br>
Primary Functions: <br>
         - Create a simulated LED panel from user input (width/height/pitch) <br>
         - Allow the user to create custom images, designs, and *(possibly)* GIFs for their personal LED panel <br>
         - Save designs to user's computer for later use <br>
         - Translate/transfer designs to an actual LED panel <br>
         - I may add the ability to upload images and GIFs to be transferred to an LED panel <br>
 <br>
Currently, I'm working to get the functionality of the app working, without an LED panel or Arduino/Raspberry Pi/etc. Once I finish this, I'll have to add code and alter the app to work with an actual panel and related hardware. <br>
<br>
Because I've never worked with an LED panel or an (Arduino), I'm not sure how big of a task this will ultimately be, but I'm excited to learn.
